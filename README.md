Title of your Program - foreign exchange converter
Describe what the program will do - Use claculations to exhange USD, Pesos, Yuan, and Pounds into each other as sleceted by the user
Provide the goals and a timeline for how you will achieve those goals - I plan to first develop the calculations then after I will most likely be able to easily change the conversion calculations for the other currencies. Finally, I will draft up a simple display 

Answer the Questions:
How will you approach an open-ended programming project? - one step at a time, work on it a little each day until the formula is done
